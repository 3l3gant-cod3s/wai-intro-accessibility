## Getting Started with Accessibility Fundamentals

<p>Accessibility standards/guidelines are a key piece of making the the web and other digital technology accessible. However, standards not a good starting point to learn about accessibility. Instead, start by understanding the fundamentals of how people with disabilities use digital technology. This page walks you through how you can start learning about accessibility, and help by sharing specific information with others.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a></dt>
  <dd>If you're new to accessibility, read this page first. IF you already know about digital accessibility, we encourage you to at least skim this page, to see if there is any information that is new to you, and to get pointers for sharing with others.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/">Video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards</a> is a 4-minutes video that is useful for getting people engaged in accessibility.</li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="/WAI/fundamentals/components/">Essential Components of Web Accessibility</a> </dt>
  <dd>This helps you understand the ecosystem of web accessibility. It explains the role of web browsers, authoring tools, web designers and developers, and more.<br>
    You might want to just skim tis page for now, so you know what's there fore when you want this information later.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">Accessibility Principles</a> </dt>
  <dd>  This is a starting point to understanding the broad requirements to make web content and tools accessible. It introduces 13 requirements with a short paragraph, a few examples in bullets, and links to more information.</dd>
